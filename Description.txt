                                               Energy Usage Dashboard â€“ EDDIE Project (Step 3)

     Overview
     This project visualizes household energy usage data using an interactive D3.js based dashboard and data is 
     provide in European CIM format (myEnergyDataMarketDocument) from three simulated households in different time zones:
     Portugal (WET, UTC+0), Germany (CET, UTC+1) and Estonia(EET, UTC+2).
     This dashboard allow users to upload XML files, select a household by time zone, and view visualizations of their energy usage.

     Features
     Multi-file Upload: it supports to uploading multiple XML datasets
     Time Zone Selector:  From dropdown menu you select WET, CET, or EET
     Line Chart: Visualizes energy consumption over time
     You can zoom in and zoom out:  Use scroll or drag to explore specific time intervals

    How to Use

    Open the index_latif.html file in any browser
    Click "Choose Files" and upload the three XML files: EE-Transformer-Output-WET.xml, EE-Transformer-Output-CET.xml and EE-Transformer-Output-EET.xml
    Select a time zone from the dropdown and View the dynamic chart rendered below

   Time Zone Handling
   The dashboard automatically adjusts and displays timestamps according to the select region's time zone. Data is internally normalized

         the HTML file (index.html) is a simple page that links to 4 individual energy usage dashboards.
         Each link opens a different dashboard, created by a member of group 27:

        dashboard_simple.html is a basic line chart that created by Felix.

        index_ali.html is time zone comparison visualization created by Ali.

        index_latif.html is a zoomable line chart with bar graph created by Mohammad Latif

        index_yernaz.html is bar and pie chart summary created by Yernaz

        This page serves as a menu for the professor to explore all dashboards easily.
